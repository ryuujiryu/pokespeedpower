## DS Party Screen (Expansion)
This feature branch is a port of the DS party screen patch for Fire Red / Emerald.

The DS party screen functionality comes from TheXaman: https://github.com/TheXaman/pokeemerald/tree/tx_ui_party_screen_ds_style_2

While the graphics & other touch ups come from the patches themselves: https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/fr-em-pok%C3%A9mon-party-screen-modifications-base-hgss-and-bw-styles.414022/

Huge credits to everyone involved!
